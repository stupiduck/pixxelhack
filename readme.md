# **AqueousNite \- Underwater Digital Experience Studio**

Welcome to the AqueousNite website repository. This is an immersive and interactive portfolio website for a fictional underwater-themed digital experience studio. This project showcases a modern, single-page application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It heavily features animations from the **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** library and a dynamic video background to create an engaging and deep-sea user experience.

## **üöÄ Live Demo**

A live version of the project is deployed on Netlify.

## **‚ú® Features**

This project is packed with modern features to create a rich, immersive experience:

* **Dynamic Video Background:** A full-screen video background of ocean currents creates an immediate sense of immersion.  
* **Elegant Pre-loader:** A custom loader with a progress counter ensures all assets are ready before the user dives in.  
* **Interactive Cursor:** A custom cursor that creates a ripple effect, mimicking disturbances in water.  
* **Seamless Page Transitions:** Smooth, full-screen transitions that feel like descending into different depths of the ocean.  
* **Advanced GSAP Animations:**  
  * **Text Animation:** Character-level reveal animations for titles that make text flow like water.  
  * **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Elements gracefully float into view as the user scrolls, powered by ScrollTrigger.  
  * **Parallax Effects:** Subtle parallax scrolling on background elements and the main video to add depth and a sense of being underwater.  
* **Interactive UI Components:**  
  * **Work Grid ("Coral Collection"):** A portfolio grid with a sleek hover effect that reveals project details and zooms into the image.  
  * **Team Section ("The Pod"):** An interactive list of team members that updates a central image on hover.
